JFS Accounting is a project for a free accounting software developed in
Java. This accounting software includes the cycles of sale, purchasing,
inventory and accounting.

See file `COPYING' for copying conditions.
See file `INSTALL' for building and installation instructions.

IntelliJ IDEA forms are used to generate parts of the GUI.  We would like to get
rid of this dependency.  For now, we recommend people to use the free software
community edition of the IDE.  It is available from: http://www.jetbrains.org/

The software was originally developed for use in Sweden, and the
internationalization might be less than satisfactory.  Let us know if you run
into problems.

The primary source directory can be found in `administration/src'.

The website can be found at http://sourceforge.net/projects/jfsaccounting
