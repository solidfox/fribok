Fribok is a project for a free accounting software developed in Java. This
software includes the cycles of sale, purchasing, inventory and accounting.

See file `COPYING' for copying conditions.
See file `INSTALL' for building and installation instructions.

To run:
$ java -jar target/fribok-2.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar

The above command must currently be run from the project root directory.

If you already have a working installation of JFS Administration/Bokf√∂ring/Fakturering: 
* Firstly do a backup in your current installation. 
* Secondly, either:
** Run the downloaded all-in-one-jar target/fribok-2.1-SNAPSHOT.jar and restore the backup.
or 
** Replace the current JFS.jar by moving over the all-in-one-jar 
target/fribok-2.1-SNAPSHOT.jar as JFS.jar in the original installation directory.

The software is developed for use in Sweden. The internationalization
is only for the UI. There are no adaptations to other legislative
areas.

Let us know if you run into any problems.

The primary source directory can be found in `src/main/java'.

The source code is hosted at http://sourceforge.net/projects/jfsaccounting
