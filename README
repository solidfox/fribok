Fribok is a project for a free accounting software developed in Java. This
software includes the cycles of sale, purchasing, inventory and accounting.

See file `COPYING' for copying conditions.
See file `INSTALL' for building and installation instructions.

To run:
$ java -jar target/fribok-0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar

The above command must currently be run from the project root directory.

If you already have a working installation of JFS Administration/Bokf√∂ring/Fakturering you can replace the current JFS.jar by moving over the jar target/fribok-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar as JFS.jar in the installation directory.

The software was originally developed for use in Sweden, and therefore the
internationalization might be less than satisfactory.  Let us know if you run
into any problems.

The primary source directory can be found in `src/main/java'.

The source code is hosted at http://sourceforge.net/projects/jfsaccounting
