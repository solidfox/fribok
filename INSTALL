JFS Administration, INSTALL file

Build requirements:
* Java SDK, version 1.6 or greater
* Apache Maven 2

The preferred way of building JFS Administration is using the Maven POM-file.

$ mvn assembly:assembly
[output...]

$ java -jar target/administration-0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar

The above command must be run from the project root directory.

Other things to try:

$ mvn compile
[output...]

$ mvn test
[output...]

IntelliJ IDEA forms are used to generate parts of the GUI.  We would like to get
rid of this dependency.  For now, we recommend people to use the free software
community edition of the IDE to edit the forms.  It is available from:
http://www.jetbrains.org/

You can also generate an IntelliJ project using Maven.

$ mvn idea:idea

If you wish, you can download the sources and javadocs of deployed artifacts for
easy access inside IntelliJ.

$ mvn idea:idea -DdownloadSources=true -DdownloadJavadocs=true

If you don't wish to use Maven, you can build JFS Administration from inside
IntelliJ IDEA.  What follows is build instructions for IntelliJ IDEA Community
Edition.

1. Start IntelliJ IDEA.

2. Open the IntelliJ IDEA project, located in `JFS Administration.ipr'.

    IDEA will now rebuild it's index.

2. Choose the menu option `Build' -> `Make project'

3. Choose the menu option `Run' -> `Edit configurations'

4. Add a new configuration as `Application', using SSBookkeeping as main class
   and `administration' as working dir. Make sure to specify an SDK to use.

5. Run the program!
