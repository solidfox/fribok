JFS Administration, INSTALL file

TODO: Add izpack instructions here.

Build requirements:
* Java SDK, version 1.6 or greater
* Apache Maven 2

The preferred way of building JFS Administration is to use the Maven POM-file.

$ mvn assembly:assembly
[output...]

$ java -jar target/administration-x.x-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar

Other things to try:

$ mvn compile
[output...]

$ mvn test
[output...]

IntelliJ IDEA forms are used to generate parts of the GUI.  We would like to get
rid of this dependency.  For now, we recommend people to use the free software
community edition of the IDE to edit the forms.  It is available from:
http://www.jetbrains.org/

Alternatively, you can build JFS Administration directly from IntelliJ IDEA.
What follows is build instructions for IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition.

1. Start IntelliJ IDEA.

2. Open the IntelliJ IDEA project, located in `JFS Administration.ipr'.

    IDEA will now rebuild it's index.

2. Choose the menu option `Build' -> `Make project'

3. Choose the menu option `Run' -> `Edit configurations'

4. Add a new configuration as `Application', using SSBookkeeping as main class
   and `administration' as working dir. Make sure to specify an SDK to use.

5. Now you can run the program.
