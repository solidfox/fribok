Fribok, INSTALL file

Build requirements:
* Java SDK, version 1.6 or greater
* Apache Maven 2

The preferred way of building Fribok is using the Maven POM-file.

$ mvn assembly:assembly
[output...]

And to run it:
$ java -jar target/fribok-0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar

The above command must be run from the project root directory.

NOTE: In case you have problem with missing files from jasperforge.org
in the build step above you might want to disable the
jasperreports.org maven repository prior to building. For your
convenience, we have a settings file for Maven that does just that. In
case you already have a ~/.m2/settings file you should append the
contents of m2-settings.xml, if not you can install it by simply:

$ mkdir ~/.m2
$ cp m2-settings.xml ~/.m2/settings.xml

Other things to try:

$ mvn compile
[output...]

$ mvn test
[output...]

IntelliJ IDEA forms are used to generate parts of the GUI.  We would like to get
rid of this dependency.  For now, we recommend people to use the free software
community edition of the IDE to edit the forms.  It is available from:
http://www.jetbrains.org/

You can also generate an IntelliJ project using Maven.

$ mvn idea:idea

If you wish, you can download the sources and javadocs of deployed artifacts for
easy access inside IntelliJ.

$ mvn idea:idea -DdownloadSources=true -DdownloadJavadocs=true

If you don't wish to use Maven, you can build Fribok from inside
IntelliJ IDEA.  What follows is build instructions for IntelliJ IDEA Community
Edition.

1. Start IntelliJ IDEA.

2. Open the IntelliJ IDEA project, located in `JFS Administration.ipr'.

    IDEA will now rebuild it's index.

2. Choose the menu option `Build' -> `Make project'

3. Choose the menu option `Run' -> `Edit configurations'

4. Add a new configuration as `Application', using SSBookkeeping as main class
   and `administration' as working dir. Make sure to specify an SDK to use.

5. Run the program!
